topomodel
======

topomodel is a simple tool that generates a surface slope and aspect from a set of  
x, y, z floating point binary grids and a byte input mask. The gradients are computed 
via 3rd order finite difference weighted by the reciprocal of the squared distance.
The kernel = standard 3, and the slope output is degrees from horizontal, the aspect 
output is degrees from the north, e.g. n=>0|360, e=>90, s=>180, w=>270.

For the purposes of this program a grid is defined as: 

```
Upper left (x,y)
    +-------------+----------------------------------+
    | element 0,0 | .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  .  |
    +-------------+                                  |   
    |     .                                          |   
    |     .                                          |   
    |     .                                          |   
    |     .                     +--------------------|
    |     .                     | element nx-1, ny-1 |
    +---------------------------+--------------------+
                                              lower right (x,y)
```
Where nx = the number of columns or samples and ny = the number of rows or lines. 
The grids must run parallel to each other as no "projection" ever takes palce. 

See the topomodel man pages for more information.

Note that this tool is used for automating the surface generation process over an arbitrary large x,y,z,m set.
